# Human Language Project

> A sophisticated web application for transforming natural language into Wikidata entity and property sequences, enabling semantic understanding and knowledge representation.

## 🎯 Vision

The Human Language project aims to create a universal meta-language that bridges all human languages by leveraging Wikidata's semantic knowledge graph. By converting natural language into sequences of entities (Q) and properties (P), we enable:

- **Cross-linguistic understanding**: Unified representation across all languages
- **Semantic precision**: Disambiguation of concepts using Wikidata's rich ontology
- **Knowledge integration**: Direct connection to the world's largest open knowledge base
- **IPA support**: Universal phonetic representation for true language unification

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Text-to-Q/P Transformation
- **N-gram support**: Recognizes multi-word phrases as single entities
- **Configurable matching**: Adjust n-gram size (1-5) for optimal results
- **Priority-based search**: Longer matches take precedence
- **Real-time transformation**: Interactive web demo at `transformation/index.html`
- [Learn more →](transformation/README.md)

### 2. Entity & Property Viewer
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive interface with dark/light themes
- **Multi-language support**: Automatic language detection and switching
- **Rich statements display**: View all properties and relationships
- **Direct Wikidata links**: Seamlessly navigate to source data
- View entities at `entities.html` and properties at `properties.html`

### 3. Advanced Search & Disambiguation
- **Exact & fuzzy matching**: Find entities even with typos
- **Context-aware ranking**: Domain and type preferences
- **Batch searching**: Efficient parallel searches
- **Multi-language search**: Search in any supported language
- [API Documentation →](SEARCH_README.md)

### 4. Intelligent Caching System
- **Multi-tier caching**: File system (Node.js) and IndexedDB (browser)
- **Automatic fallback**: Seamless switching between cache types
- **Performance optimized**: Reduces API calls and improves response times
- **Cross-platform**: Works in both Node.js and browser environments
- **Persistent storage**: Cached data survives across sessions

### 5. Comprehensive Language Support
- **100+ languages**: Full support for all major Wikidata languages
- **Locale-specific quotes**: Proper quotation marks for each language
- **Flag emojis**: Visual language indicators for better UX
- **Language persistence**: Settings saved in localStorage

   - Parallel search execution
   - Priority-based result merging

3. **Search Utilities** (`wikidata-api.js`)
   - Exact and fuzzy search algorithms
   - Context-aware ranking system
   - Multi-language support

4. **Caching System** (`unified-cache.js`)

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

The text transformation system currently has some limitations:

1. **Negation handling**: Phrases with "not" aren't properly processed
2. **Question parsing**: Direct questions (who, what, when) aren't supported
3. **Verb tenses**: Past/future tenses may not be accurately captured
4. **Pronoun resolution**: Cannot resolve pronouns like "he", "she", "it"
5. **Complex sentences**: Struggles with subordinate clauses

See `limitations-found.json` for detailed test results.
